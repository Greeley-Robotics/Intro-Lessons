# Week 2 - Robot Control and Sensors in Java

## Objective:

Welcome to Week 2 of our FRC Robotics Club Software  Department lessons! This week, we'll focus on robot control mechanisms, introduction to sensors, and practical exercises on incorporating sensors in your Java code.

## Lesson Plan:

### 1. **Review of Week 1:**
   - Brief recap of Java programming basics covered in Week 2.
   - Address any questions or concerns from the previous week.

### 2. **Understanding Robot Control Mechanisms:**
   - Overview of how robots are controlled in the context of FRC.
   - Introduction to teleoperated and autonomous modes.

### 3. **Introduction to Sensors:**
   - Understanding the role of sensors in robotics.
   - Overview of common sensors used in FRC (e.g., encoders, gyros, accelerometers).

### 4. **Practical Exercises with Sensors in Java:**
   - Hands-on coding exercises incorporating sensors in Java programs.
   - Testing and debugging sensor-based code.

### 5. **Coding Exercise: Implementing a Sensor-Based Robot Control:**
   - Building a Java program that utilizes sensors for robot control.
   - Testing and refining the sensor-based control.
